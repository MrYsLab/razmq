# The Razmq Communications Framework

![](https://github.com/MrYsLab/razmq/blob/master/documentation/images/razbot.png)

The _**razmq framework**_ is a non-blocking, event driven, asynchronous communication messaging 
system used to efficiently and effectively control physical computing devices such as robots. It makes extensive use of 
the ZeroMQ distributed messaging system coupled with the MessagePack protocol messaging platform.

To demonstrate its use, sample code is provided illustrating control of a Raspberry Pi 3 
based modifed [Sparkfun RedBot](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12649) robot. 
Construction of the modified RedBot is described [here](https://goo.gl/LSI7km).

A Kivy based GUI is provided to drive the robot.
